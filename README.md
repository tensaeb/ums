University Management System.

There are two branches, front and back

you can get it in the branches drop-down button

on the backend, there are three routes
 - http://localhost:8080/api/students
 - http://localhost:8080/api/courses
 - http://localhost:8080/api/grades

I understand that you may not be able to access these links, but you can make modifications under the code I provided.

The front end still requires substantial work, but you can review my architectural approach and gain insights into my thought process. Thank you! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
